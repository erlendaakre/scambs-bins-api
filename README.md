# scambs-bins-api
Parser and REST API proxy server for South Cambridgeshire Council Bins (iCalendar)

A intermediary rest api for https://www.scambs.gov.uk/bins/
Will parse the ical public link for your address and provide a more usable API.

Primarily made for smart home integration (reminding me to take out the right coloured bin)

uses Scala, Cats and Http4s

*NOTE: currently WIP and not working*
